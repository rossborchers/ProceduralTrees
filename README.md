Based on the book [The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithmic-Beauty-Plants-Virtual-Laboratory/dp/0387946764)

A naive implementation using text. Quite slow but easy to understand.

The example scene has a fully deterministic "random" loop. I used to render the gif above. Not neccisarily realtime depending on your computer.

Its pretty extensible but has some performance issues.

I would not use this in production without optomizing and fixing some bugs.
